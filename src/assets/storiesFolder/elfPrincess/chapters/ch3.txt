The shimmering time portal, woven from threads of starlight and ancient spells, whisked them away to a bustling street in India, three years in the past. Princess Ayri looked around in awe, her mother's magic always had a way of surprising her. The vibrant colors, the rich aromas of spices, and the cacophony of city life were a stark contrast to their serene kingdom. Yet, her curiosity quickly turned to concern as she noticed four newborn puppies crying in hunger, their tiny voices lost amidst the noise.

Queen Sarmin, with a wave of her hand, conjured another portal. This time, it sparkled like a million fireflies, guiding them to a different place. They found themselves in a quieter part of the city, where the mother dog was desperately searching for food. Suddenly, a harsh cry pierced the air, and a man threw a brick at the dog. The mother dog fell and passed away instantly.Princess Ayri's heart shattered.

"Great, I put her down. These strays do nothing but threaten children in our society," the man yelled, his words echoing in Ayri's ears. Anger and sadness swirled within her.

"No!" Ayri screamed, her eyes filling with tears. She reached for her wand, but her mother's spell held her back. "Why, Mother? Why can't we help?"

"The past cannot be changed, my dear," Queen Sarmin whispered, her voice tinged with sorrow. "We are here to observe and learn."

In the blink of an eye, the portal whisked them away again, landing them a year later. Only two of the puppies had survived, and one of them, a little black dog named Kalu, had found a new home. Kalu was now a beloved pet, his tail wagging with joy as his owner returned home. But Ayri's joy was short-lived as she saw the chain around Kalu's neck, preventing him from following his owner inside.

"At least Kalu has someone who loves him and a roof over his head," Ayri thought, trying to find solace in the dog's situation.

Once more, the magical portal enveloped them, transporting them to a time when Kalu was two years old. This time, Ayri saw Kalu off-leash, happily following his owner who was loading belongings into a truck. Ayri's heart lifted as she watched Kalu's excitement. But then, to her horror, she saw the truck driving away, leaving Kalu behind.

"No! Stop!" Ayri cried, running after the truck. But it was too late. Kalu chased the truck, his small legs unable to keep up, until he finally collapsed in exhaustion.

Princess Ayri fell to her knees, tears streaming down her face. "Why, Mother? Why did we have to see this?"

Queen Sarmin knelt beside her, wrapping her arms around Ayri. "Sometimes, the most important lessons are the hardest to learn".

The portal opened once again, shimmering with magical light. Ayri took a deep breath and followed her mother inside, ready to be transported to another moment in time.

Once upon a time, in the enchanting kingdom of Masari, there lived an elf princess named Ayri. The king and queen of Masari were kind and caring rulers who loved their people very much. But Princess Ayri often felt lonely and grumpy because she was the only child and spent most of her time alone in her glittering, golden room.

One sunny day, Ayri looked out from her palace window. The view outside was like a scene from a dream. Elf fairies were twirling and laughing in the garden, their wings shimmering in the sunlight. The garden was a magical place, filled with flowers of every color and herbs that sparkled with enchantment. Little house elves, with their tiny hands and cheerful smiles, were busy taking care of the plants. A beautiful rainbow stretched across the sky, and a light mist made everything sparkle like diamonds.

But even with all this magic, Princess Ayri still felt grumpy. Suddenly, she saw a dog wandering in the garden. Her eyes widened in surprise and annoyance. "How did a scruffy creature like that get into my magical garden?" she wondered. She pointed at the dog and said to the guards, "Catch it and bring it to me."

The poor dog, thin and hungry, had somehow found its way to the Masari kingdom looking for food. The guards gently brought the dog to the princess's room. As the dog entered, Princess Ayri wrinkled her nose at the smell and the trail of mud it left behind. Her cheeks turned red with anger.

Dog’s tail wagged with excitement as he spotted Princess Ayri in the grand hall. His eyes sparkled with joy and curiosity. With a playful bounce, he trotted over to her, his muddy paws leaving little tracks on the floor. As he approached, he couldn’t help but leap onto her glittering gown, leaving a muddy paw print on its sparkling surface.

Princess Ayri’s eyes grew wide with shock as she saw the stain. Her face turned a deep shade of red, and her voice rang out with a mix of surprise and anger. “You wretched little creature!” she exclaimed, her voice trembling. “You deserve to vanish forever!”

In her frustration, Princess Ayri recited an ancient and forbidden spell from the elvish language. “Mouriz Fin!” she shouted. The spell, known throughout the Masari kingdom for its fearsome power, was meant to make someone disappear in an instant. But Princess Ayri was still learning her magic, and the spell didn’t work as she intended.

Instead of vanishing, the poor dog was left badly hurt but very much alive. His whimpering filled the room, and his eyes showed a mix of pain and confusion.

Meanwhile, Queen Sarmin, the wise and gentle elf queen, was in the middle of a royal meeting when she felt a sudden surge of dark magic. Realizing something was terribly wrong, she hurried to the princess’s chambers.

When Queen Sarmin arrived, her heart sank at the sight of the injured dog. Her face changed from worry to a stern determination. Without a word, she turned to Princess Ayri, her eyes filled with a mixture of disappointment and urgency.

Without waiting for a response, Queen Sarmin raised her magic wand and pointed it at one of the chamber’s walls. “Drizya Aroha!” she chanted. The wall sparkled and shimmered, transforming into a swirling, glowing portal.

Queen Sarmin took Princess Ayri’s hand firmly and said, “Come with me.” Her tone was firm and resolute. Without explaining anything further, she led the princess towards the magical portal. The air around them crackled with magic as they stepped through, leaving the chamber behind.

As they entered the portal, it enveloped them in a dazzling swirl of colors, a vibrant and mesmerizing display of light. The world around them turned into a magical swirl of shimmering hues, guiding them on a mysterious and enchanting journey.

Kanak was a bright and cheerful 7-year-old boy with a heart full of adventure. As he bounced along in the school bus, his laughter mingled with the chatter of his friends. They were deep into a game of "Power Rangers," their imaginations soaring as high as the clouds outside. Kanak was the star of their group, always ready with a funny story or a new joke. He was like a tiny ball of sunshine, spreading joy wherever he went.

As the bus rumbled to a stop, the friendly conductor called out, "Alright, Kanak, it's time to go home, buddy!" Kanak gave a big wave to his friends, promising to continue their Power Rangers game tomorrow, and hopped off the bus. His caretaker, Vijay, was waiting with a warm smile, ready to take him home.

"How was your day, Kanak?" Vijay asked, taking Kanak’s backpack with a gentle hand.

Kanak shrugged, his usual sparkle dimming a bit. "Just fine," he replied, not quite as lively as before. He used to turn cold as he crossed the threshold of his home, a place that felt empty and lonely without his father's company.

As he walked into his house, he glanced at a picture of his mother hanging on the wall. The photograph was of a woman with a warm smile and kind eyes. Kanak’s heart ached a little because he had never met her. His mother had passed away when he was just a baby, and though he knew her from the photos and stories, he missed her in a way he couldn’t quite explain.

His father, Manak, was a kind man with a busy life. He was always working, but whenever he had time, he made sure Kanak knew he was loved. Manak had promised Kanak a special birthday shopping trip, with his birthday just 17 days away, and Kanak couldn’t wait.

That evening, while Kanak was watching his favorite show, Naruto, Vijay approached him with a deeply sorrowful expression. Kneeling beside Kanak, he gently said, "Kanak, I have some very sad news to share. Your father... he had an accident, and he’s no longer with us."

Kanak’s world seemed to shatter. The vibrant colors of Naruto blurred as tears streamed down his face. The heavy weight of the news felt like an invisible hand squeezing his heart. He was overwhelmed with grief and disbelief, struggling to grasp the reality of the loss.

At the funeral, the house was filled with faces he didn’t recognize, and the air was thick with quiet sorrow. In the midst of the crowd, two elderly figures approached Kanak. A man and a woman in their early sixties. The woman wrapped Kanak in a warm embrace, her tears soaking into his shirt. The man stood by her side, his eyes glistening, though he remained composed.

With a tender, yet firm voice, the man spoke, "Kanak, we’re here to take you with us. We’ll be leaving tomorrow."

Kanak’s eyes widened, and he shook his head. "No, I don’t want to leave my home. I don’t know you!"

The woman, still holding him close, said through her tears, "We are Vritika’s parents—your grandparents. We lost touch with her when she chose a different path and left our clan to be with your father. Although we haven’t seen her in many years, she’s always been in our hearts. Your grandmother requests you to come with us now."

Kanak was overwhelmed, his mind racing with questions. He felt a mix of fear and curiosity, but the details were still unclear. Without another word, he ran to his room, tears streaming down his face.

The next morning, his grandparents were already waiting, their faces soft with sadness but also with a hint of something more—something mysterious and unknown. As Kanak left with them, he had no idea what awaited him. Little did he know, his journey was just beginning, and magical adventures lay ahead, waiting to unfold.
